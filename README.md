# QUANTUM TELEPORTATION
Quantum Teleportation of a single quantum bit over a full-entangled channel.
In this project, we will use Quantum computer to teleport the state of one quit from one persons qubit to another without moving the qubit. Based on the theories, we will implement the idea of EPR / Bell pairs to create entangled states of qubits and then applying protocol we would be able to re create the state . 
We will use IBM Qiskit for simulation and run it in real Quantum Computer.

# What is Quantum Teleportation :
We are all familiar with the word "TELEPORTATION" , litterally means transfer of any object physically from one place to another . Well, in Quantum Computing , this term has a specific meaning .Quantum teleportation is the idea of transporting quantum information from one sender to another without sending the object itself. In 1993 an international group of six scientists, including IBM Fellow Charles H. Bennett, showed that perfect teleportation is indeed possible in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.
